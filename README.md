# 4digit-7segment-clock-using-arduino
/*   *  Developer Uday Chandrashekara  *  Company : Oscki labs  *  This code is for clock of 4 digit 7 segment common anode  *  Board : arduino   *  h1= pin 7 (1st hour digit Anode pin)  *  h2= pin 8  (2nd hour digit Anode pin)  *  m1= pin 9 (1st min digit Anode pin)  *  m2= pin 10  (2nd min digit Anode pin)  *  in case of bigger display each digits can be connected to a transistor can be connected to the digits and the above mentioned pin can control the transistor  *    *    *  all the 4 digits segments are connected to the pics as shown below           *                 0  *           ____________  *          |            |  *        5 |            |   1  *          |      6     |  *          |____________|  *          |            |  *        4 |            |   2  *          |            |     *          |____________|  *                3  *                  *   *     Assuming the rtc is already updated this program is done  *       *       */
